	<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="https://github.com/Shamya/EmotionDetectionInteractionLogs">Affect Detector For Tutoring Systems</a>
			<p>We designed and optimized a model to predict student affect (boredom, confusion, frustration, and concentration) from events logged in an online tutoring system, such as problem completion time, number of hints requested, and so on.</p>

			<a href="https://github.com/rezecib/ZebraSwish">ZebraSwish</a>
			<p>A program for use in research on zebrafish larval movement behavior. It will be able to automatically detect zebrafish larvae in video and find their head-tail angle in each frame, as well as provide tools for annotating or correcting the automatically detected information.</p>

	<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

		<li>
			<a href="https://amrl.cs.umass.edu/index.php?id=robots">RoboCup SSL Strategy</a>
			<p><a href="http://wiki.robocup.org/Small_Size_League">RoboCup SSL</a> is a robot soccer competition with small wheeled robots. I worked on implementing some of the strategy layer for the robots, a system called <a href="http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=robotics">Skills, Tactics, Plays</a>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://github.com/rezecib/Visual-Vote-Counter">Visual Vote Counter</a>
			<p>A quick project of mine that was used at a "Shark Tank"-style investing event, where several teams presented their projects and the audience voted on which one to fund. This program detected and counted audience votes by recognizing colored flags they held up.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://github.com/marshall62/mathspring">Mathspring</a>
			<p>An online tutoring system for middle-school math, intended as a platform for education and tutoring systems research.</p>

	<h3>Don't Starve Mods and Tools</h3>
	<p><a href="https://www.kleientertainment.com/games/dont-starve">Don't Starve</a> (along with the multiplayer version <a href="https://www.kleientertainment.com/games/dont-starve-together">Don't Starve Together</a>) is one of my favorite games, an unforgiving wilderness survival game with an endearing but subtly dark art style. It has a really great system for mods-- most of the game's code is distributed as Lua source, and mods are mostly free to modify anything in it.</p>
