<p>My motivation for getting into machine learning was the hope that I might be able to contribute to the development of robust intelligences like our own. Of course, it's difficult to determine where to go in order to best fulfill that. Currently I've been exploring deep learning, and I'm intrigued by spiking neural nets but haven't had the opportunity to work with them yet.</p>
