	<p>I'm a computer science graduate student at <a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>. I'm interesting in a wide variety of applications of machine learning and deep learning, and also in education technology. Previously I studied biological engineering as an undergraduate student at <a href="http://bee.cals.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a></p>
